Here lies a list of animations and interactive visualisations I have made. Some of these are even used as the background of this site!

Most of these animations have a mathematical theme and were coded in [p5.js](https://p5js.org). Click on an animation to find out more about it, how it was coded, where I got the inspiration and a link to play with the code yourself.

Have fun!
