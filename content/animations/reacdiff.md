<!-- The Chemistry of Patterns

The Inspiration: Named after the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. It mimics how chemicals diffuse through a medium and react with one another to create spots, stripes, and spirals (Turing Patterns).

How it’s Coded: This uses a Cellular Automata approach. Each pixel calculates its next state based on the Laplacian of its neighbors:
∂t∂A​=Da​∇2A−AB2+f(1−A)

Technical Highlight: It requires high-performance pixel manipulation. To make it work in a browser, we often use a grid of values rather than objects to handle the heavy math of thousands of "cells" reacting simultaneously.
