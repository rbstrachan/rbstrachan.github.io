<!-- The Geometry of Nature

The Inspiration: Voronoi diagrams are found everywhere: from the patterns on a giraffe’s coat to the structure of dragonfly wings and even how cell towers decide coverage areas.

How it’s Coded: * For any given set of "seed" points, a Voronoi cell consists of every point in the plane that is closer to that seed than any other.

In the animation, as the seeds (points) move, the boundaries (edges) are recalculated in real-time.

Technical Highlight: Calculating a true Voronoi diagram is computationally expensive (O(nlogn)). We use the Delaunay Triangulation as a dual-graph to find the edges more efficiently.
