<!-- Physical Typography

The Inspiration: This is a playful take on the "falling sand" or "physics toy" genre. It turns the keyboard—usually a tool for work—into a kinetic fountain.

How it’s Coded: * Event Listeners: It uses the keyPressed() function to trigger the creation of a new Key object.

Gravity: A constant value is added to the vertical velocity (vy) every frame, creating a parabolic arc.

Elastic Collision: When a key hits the bottom (height), the velocity is inverted and multiplied by 0.7 to simulate energy loss (dampening).

Technical Highlight: The use of Push/Pop matrices. By translating the origin to the key's center and rotating, we can spin each key independently without affecting the rest of the canvas.
