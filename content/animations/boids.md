<!-- The Simulation of Collective Behavior

The Inspiration: Based on Craig Reynolds’ 1986 "Boids" program. It captures the "emergent behavior" seen in starling murmurations and fish schools.

How it’s Coded: Each boid follows three simple local rules that result in complex global patterns:

Separation: Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.

Alignment: Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates.

Cohesion: Steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates.

Technical Highlight: The use of vector math to calculate steering forces. Instead of telling a boid where to go, we apply a force Desired−Velocity to create smooth, lifelike turns.
