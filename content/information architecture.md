what is an information architect? (note should be written on information architecture more than an information architect?)

An Information Architect (IA) is essentially the "blueprint maker" for complex sets of information. While a UI designer focuses on how a button looks, an IA focuses on how the information is categorized, labeled, and navigated so that a user can actually find what they need.

define as? The practice of deciding how to arrange the parts of something to be understandable. In the digital world, this involves creating site maps, hierarchies, and taxonomies. In a library context, it’s about how metadata and classification systems (like Dewey or LoC) allow for the retrieval of knowledge.
