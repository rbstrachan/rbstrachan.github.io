interactive background animation - [[voronoi|voronoi tesselation]]
interactive backgrounds animations are custom [[p5.js]] sketches running in Instance Mode.
Voronoi Tesselation: A dynamic tessellation where the plane is partitioned into regions based on distance to "seed" points. The cursor acts as a primary seed, distorting the cells using a $L_2$ Euclidean distance metric—
Boids Flocking: An emergent behavior simulation based on Craig Reynolds' three rules: Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion.
Reaction-Diffusion: A simulation of chemical morphogenesis using the Gray-Scott model.
