In the study of linguistics, **computational linguistics** is an interdisciplinary field that combines linguistics and computer science to analyse and understand human language using computational methods.

There are two main applications for **computational linguistics**, (a) helping computers process and generate language as humans do, through tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis; and (b) helping humans understand the intrinsic properties of a language by, for example, meta-analysis of the languages morphemes. <!-- This paragraph, particularly part (b) needs to be rewritten -->

<!-- It focuses on how computers can be programmed to process and generate language, enabling better interaction between humans and machines. -->
