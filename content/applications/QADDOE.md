**[QADDOE](https://reiwa.ca/qaddoe)** is a free, open-source desktop [[Qualitative Data Analysis]] application that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Designed by and for researchers, **QADDOE** offers a powerful qualitative coding workflow, integral document security and code management without the overhead of unnecessary features.

# How QADDOE came to be
The idea for **QADDOE** grew out of a shared frustration. While working alongside a professor and one of his PhD students at the [[Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières]], I saw first-hand how the current state of qualitative data analysis software was holding researchers back. For years, the industry-standard tools have become increasingly bloated and slow. More concerning, however, is how restrictive they’ve become — not just by locking users into their ecosystems and export formats, but by forcing researchers to adopt the company’s own opinionated workflows. Researchers shouldn't have to fight their tools to get their work don, so we decided to build a alternative.
# Our design ethos
Our philosophy is built on the idea that software should facilitate research rather than dictate it. We embrace a sense of feature-minimalism, focusing entirely on the essential tools needed for rigorous coding and analysis. By avoiding unnecessary features that clutter the interface, we leave the actual control in your hands.

Central to this is the belief that your data should always remain yours. We use open export formats and rely on markdown files (which are essentially text files with formatting) that can be read by any text program. This ensures that your project can be moved to any other software at any time without friction.

We believe the true power of analysis lies with the researcher. Our goal is to empower the user by keeping the software free of charge, easy to use, and open to everyone. Analysis shouldn't be a privilege reserved for those with the big budgets. We are committed to continuous improvement, constantly evolving **QADDOE** to be more intuitive while staying true to the needs of the people using it.

We do not, and never will, incorporate AI into **QADDOE**.
# Our mission
To democratize analysis by providing an affordable, user-friendly tool that empowers researchers of all backgrounds to turn raw data into meaningful insights. We are dedicated to breaking down the barriers that usually limit analysis, whether those are related to age, location, education, or financial resources.

We strongly believe the user should always be in total control to decide which questions to ask and how to interpret their findings. We also believe in future-proofing your work; your data will always be accessible regardless of which software you choose to use in the future. Ultimately, we want to build a community of informed minds where anyone can leverage the power of analysis for a deeper understanding of the world. By upholding these values, we aim to make the entire research experience more accessible and empowering for everyone.
# What’s coming up
The application is currently in its beta phase, but we are moving quickly toward the release of version 1. This is a major milestone for the project and will introduce several significant changes. We are launching a brand new interface that has been redesigned from the ground up to provide better focus and clarity while you work. We are also focusing on improving the overall conviviality of the app to ensure the learning curve is much shallower for those new to the field. Finally, we have implemented significant speed optimizations to ensure that **QADDOE** stays lightweight and fast, even as your research projects grow in size and complexity.
