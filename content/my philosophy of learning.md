<!-- Below are my axioms — the self-evident truths that justify why the rest of the guide exists. -->
## Anyone can learn a language regardless of the amount of money they can spend doing so

> **TL;DR**<br>
> We believe that education should be free and open. Each and every one of the methods and resources we recommend to you are completely free, forever, and are designed to be used by anyone, anywhere, at anytime.

<!-- EXPAND -->
## A person's situation should not limit their opportunities

> **TL;DR**<br>
> We strongly believe that knowledge and culture supersede borders and circumstances. Where someone comes from, how old they are, what they do or do not work as, how much money they have, etc. should not be deciding factors when it comes to learning.

Your situation might dictate your pace, but it should never dictate your potential.

## Learning is personal (?)

> **TL;DR**<br>
> There is no such thing as the ‘average’ student.
> Everyone learns differently at different speeds with different interests and needs.

We recognize that every learner has unique circumstances, emotional considerations, neurodivergent needs^[find a better term] and learning styles. The pedagogy^[?] must be adaptable to the learner, not the other way round.

## The only person who can teach you a language is yourself

> **TL;DR**<br>
> People who are not fluent cannot make you fluent because they are not fluent.
> People who *are* fluent cannot make you fluent because they don't understand how.
> Only you can bring yourself to fluency. This guide is designed to help get you there.

Non-native learners are, by definition, not fluent and can therefore only teach you what very little they know, which is riddled with mistakes.

Native speakers, although fluent, are unconscious competents — they have mastered the language, but can’t explain how. They can not bring you to fluency because they themselves do not remember how they learned the language, and you can not teach what you do not know. Being a native speaker is an accident of birth, not a skill. They don't understand what is hard and what is not^[rewrite this section], because everything is natural to them. Asking a native speaker technical linguistic questions is like asking a bird how it calculates wind resistance; it just flies.

It is important to understand that this is not a step-by-step instruction manual to learning a language— unfortunately, no such things exists. Instead, this is guide is a roadmap to fluency.^[expand what that means? a list of skills needed, how to improve those skills and the resources required to do so?]
That does not mean that you cannot achieve fluency with this guide — au contraire. What it does mean, however, is that since neither non-native nor native can, you are the only person that has the ability to bring you to fluency.

As a result, it will be necessary to put in many thousands of hours of work to get there. It is impossible for us to give you a step-by step walkthrough with timestamps on how to learn a language for everyone - or anyone for that matter - because learning a language is not an exact science, but something that is unique for everyone.

<!-- ADD TEXT ON HOW THIS GUIDE TEACHES THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO LEARN A LANGUAGE, AS WELL AS THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PRACTICE THOSE SKILLS. -->
## Practice doesn't make perfect; perfect practice makes perfect

> **TL;DR**<br>
> Any progress is not better than no progress if said progress is in the wrong direction.
> Practicing a mistake will only habitualise that mistake. Refining your proficiency requires not only practice, but perfect practice.

## A difference in ability should not provoke a difference in accessibility^[potential?]

> **TL;DR**<br>
> We recognise that learners interact^[interface?] with the world through different interfaces^[??] and refuse to accept the idea that a difference in abilities necessarily results in a difference in potential. Access to high-quality, accessible education^[al material?] is a fundamental human right for every learner, regardless of how one perceives or processes it.

Disability<!-- Inability? --> is a failure of design, not a failure of the learner. A learner’s physical or cognitive interface with the world should never be the bottleneck of their education. A blind student and a sighted student should arrive at the same level of mastery, even if they took different sensory paths to get there.^[rewrite this sentence to be more general (remove blind/sighted words)]

In cases where there is a discrepancy between a learners ^[what?] and the learning environment, it is the responsibility of the environment to adapt itself to the learners needs.

The integrity of an educational system should never be sacrificed for the convenience of its design.

Accessible does not mean<!--^[is not synonymous with]--> simplified.

The mode of delivery must never limit the depth of the discovery.

We hold that the difficulty of a language resides in the technical complexity of its grammar and culture, not in the font size of a textbook or the audio quality of a recording. If a resource is only usable by some who access it, it is objectively ineffective. We advocate for a learning environment where the depth of information is decoupled from the method of its delivery; the truth of the language remains the same regardless of how it is seen, heard, or felt.
