<!-- cross-linguistic evolution and standardization of Braille research
cross-linguistic Braille evolution
standards and accessibility, your research could involve:

- Transcription Standards: Comparing how different languages handle "contractions" (Grade 2 Braille). For example, how French Braille handles accented characters versus how Japanese Tenji uses a completely different phonetic cell structure.
- Digital Interoperability: Investigating how BRF (Braille Ready Files) and PEF (Portable Embosser Format) handle multilingual texts.
- Universal Design: Can we create a more unified "global" Braille standard that reduces the barrier for language learners who are visually impaired?
- Information Retrieval: How do library catalogs index tactile materials in multiple languages?

I'm Ross, an<!-- [[information architecture| --> **information architect**<!-- ]] -->-in-training who enjoys mathematics, coding, automating things, and exploring the many<!-- [[ --> **interfaces between humans and machines**<!-- ]] -->. I'm a strong advocate for <!-- [[my philosophy of learning| -->free, open and accessible education<!-- ]] --> for everyone.

I'm currently studying for the [[TEFL Level 5 course|TEFL Level 5 diploma]]. <!-- Book a trial English or French lesson with me on [Preply]() or [italki]()! -->

My background is in <!-- [[ -->**Mathematics & Computer Science**<!-- ]] -->, specifically [[computational linguistics]]. I'd like to pursue a Master's in <!-- [[ -->**Library & Information Sciences**<!-- ]] --> at l'Université de Montréal to research the differences in the implementation of [[Braille]] across international writing systems.
